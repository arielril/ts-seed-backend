# node-ts-seed

## Description
This is a project totally based in [this project](https://github.com/4alltecnologia/node-ts-seed). I made some changes to use jest, ramda and other packages that I prefer.

### Installing and testing the app

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```

### Building production version
 
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

The folder "lib" should be commited in master branch to install this package using git.

### TSLint

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run lint
```
